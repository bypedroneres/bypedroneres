  <h3> ✺ PEDRO NERES ✺ </h3>
  <h5>Full Stack Developer & Computer Science Student</h5>
  I'm a Brazilian polyglot digital nomad traveling across the world. I have more than 7 years of experience as a Designer and 3 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, always creating minimalist websites for personal use or for companies in general.

I'm currently studying computer science at Ada tech, looking for an international remote vacancy where I can develop more of each of the 7 languages that I speak: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, French and Korean.
